							<h2>About Me<br /></h2>
						</header>
						
						
						<p> In the broadest terms, my research focuses on making optimal decisions from limited information. 
							Mathematically, I work on multivariate/infinite-dimensional interpolation/extension/approximation problems
							and some of the mathematical aspects of machine learning. 
						</p> 

						<p>I will be joining the City University of Hong Kong as an assistant professor in Spring 2026.</p>

						<p> I was a Postdoctoral Researcher affiliated with 
							the Norbert Wiener Center for Harmonic Analysis and Applications at the University of Maryland, 
							under the supervision of <a href = "https://www.math.umd.edu/~rvbalan/">Radu Balan</a> 
							and
							<a href="https://www.math.umd.edu/~czaja/">Wojciech Czaja</a>. 
							I also did a one-semester postdoctoral residency at 
							the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) at Brown University. 
							I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics in 2022 at the University of California, Davis, under the supervision of 
							<a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~kluli/">Kevin Luli</a>. My disseration was on Whitney extension theory with convex constraints.

								<h3>Data Interpolation and Extrapolation</h3>
								<p>At the basic level, Whitney's problems ask for efficient and universal ways to fit a function 
									to random data while minimizing some energies. 
									I am particularly interested in how constraints, 
									such as positivity or convexity, preserve or alter the structure of these problems. 
									Here is an <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-08-01240-8/S0273-0979-08-01240-8.pdf
									">expository article</a>
									with an overview of Whitney's problems. 
									Picture: A Whitney decomposition with respect to data sampled near a sine curve. </p>

								<h3>Matching Networks and Pointclouds</h3>
								<p>The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance is a powerful tool from optimal transport 
									for comparing datasets across different metric spaces, 
									widely used in network analysis and geometry processing. 
									However, GW is sensitive to outliers and cannot handle partial matching. 
									We study a relaxed version of GW and analyze its geometric properties. 
									Building on this, we introduce a new family of robust distances that overcome GW's limitations
									and offer improved robustness to noise and incomplete data.
									Picture: GW distance between two sets of circles and ellipses.

								<h3>\(L_1\) localization and sparsity estimation</h3>
								<p>A problem posed by H. Feichtinger (and subsequently by C. Heil and D. Larson) asks
									whether an \(L_1\) version of Mercer's Theorem will hold. 
									One can formulate the finite-dimensional variant of the problem in terms of 
									an optimal matrix factorization problem in \(\ell_1\). 
									In a recent paper with R. Balan, 
									we showed that the answer is no in general, but we also provide
									interesting positive cases with connection to classical subjects such 
									nuclear or 2-factorizable operators.
